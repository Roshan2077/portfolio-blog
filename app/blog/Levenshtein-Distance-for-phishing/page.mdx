# Levenshtein Distance: How Attackers Use Simple Math to Fool Your Eyes

Hey #DevCommunity, let's talk about deception.

The recent npm supply chain scare was a masterclass in social engineering, but it also highlighted a timeless hacking technique: visual trickery. The whole thing kicked off with a fake domain, `mpmjs.help`, designed to fool a busy developer. This is a modern example of a classic attack vector that preys on our brain's tendency to see what it expects to see.

This tactic can be automated and scaled with a surprisingly simple algorithm: the Levenshtein distance.

## What is Levenshtein Distance?

In simple terms, the Levenshtein distance is a metric that counts the minimum number of single-character edits—insertions, deletions, or substitutions—needed to change one string into another. For example, the Levenshtein distance between "google" and "goggle" is 1, because only a single insertion (`g`) is required.

Attackers use this concept to mass-produce "typosquatted" domain names that are just one or two edits away from a legitimate one. They know that a small Levenshtein distance often means the domains will look nearly identical to the human eye, especially when we're moving fast.

## Mass-Producing Deception

Let's see how an attacker could weaponize this. Imagine they want to target users of a major site like `amazon.com`. They can write a simple script to generate hundreds of look-alike domains by applying single-character edits.

### 1. Substitution: Replacing one character

This is especially effective with "homoglyphs"—characters that look alike, like 'o' and '0', or 'l' and '1'.

- `amazan.com` (n for m)
- `amaz0n.com` (0 for o)
- `arnazon.com` (r+n looks like m)

### 2. Insertion: Adding a single character

- `ammazon.com`
- `amazonn.com`

### 3. Deletion: Removing a single character

- `amzon.com`
- `amaon.com`

### 4. Transposition: Swapping two adjacent characters

(This is technically measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance, a close cousin of the original).

- `amzaon.com`

An attacker can generate a list of these domains, register the available ones, and set up phishing sites. The goal is to create a URL that, at a quick glance, passes the "eyeball test".

## A Surprisingly Simple Defense: The Font

While complex security systems work to detect these threats, one of the most interesting countermeasures isn't an algorithm, but a design choice: the font.

Many standard fonts are designed for style and readability, not for character clarity. They can make it difficult to distinguish between similar characters, which is exactly what attackers exploit.

Consider using a font specifically designed to make these distinctions obvious. Fonts popular with programmers and security professionals are excellent for this because they are built to prevent coding errors caused by character confusion.

> A great example is IBM Plex Mono.

Look at how it handles potentially confusing characters:

- The number zero (`0`) has a dot in the middle to distinguish it from the letter 'O'.
- The lowercase 'L' (`l`) has a distinct curve at the bottom, setting it apart from the number one (`1`) and the uppercase 'I'.

By simply changing the default font in your browser, email client, or code editor to something like IBM Plex Mono, you give yourself a better chance of spotting a typosquatted domain. It's a low-tech "hack" that directly counters the visual deception at the heart of these attacks.

## Conclusion

The battle against phishing is fought on many fronts, but it often comes down to a contest between the attacker's cleverness and the user's attention to detail. Choosing the right font can give you a small but significant edge.

### Questions for Reflection

- How else might we improve our visual defenses against phishing?
- What other simple, non-technical solutions might help combat sophisticated attacks?
